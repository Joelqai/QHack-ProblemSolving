Welcome to [QHack](https://qhack.ai), the quantum machine learning hackathon! We're thrilled to have the opportunity to meet and work with such a large and diverse group of participants, and we look forward to interacting with you all during the event.

This year's event consists of three main components:

- **[QHack Live Stream](https://twitch.tv/qhack)**: We will be streaming at [twitch.tv/qhack](https://twitch.tv/qhack). Join us for three days of talks from an amazing set of guest speakers. 

- **[QHack QML Challenges](QML_Challenges.md)**: Build your skills by tackling a series of QML challenge questions for all skill levels. 

- **[QHack Open Hackathon](Open_Hackathon.md)**: Show the world what you can do with [PennyLane](https://pennylane.ai) and [Amazon Braket](https://aws.amazon.com/braket/)! Dream up your own hackathon project, or start from one of our seed ideas. 

The up-to-date event schedule can be found [here](https://qhack.ai/schedule.html).
